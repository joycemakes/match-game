/*
 * MATCH quest: "The Professor Who Won't Disappear"   (file: quests/professor-vale.js)
 *
 * The player never leaves their bedroom. Everything happens through the phone:
 *   - Hinge chats   (topics depend on her faction; some named women have their own lines)
 *   - Phone calls   (University Office, newsroom and police lines that already exist,
 *                    plus numbers discovered during the quest, listed in Contacts)
 *   - Voicemails    (people ring back with news, in the Calls app's Voicemail tab)
 *   - The newspaper (the existing Vale stories, plus stories and classifieds this quest prints)
 *   - The room      (parcels on the doorstep, the desk where the device is built,
 *                    and the bedroom sequences for arrests and deaths)
 *
 * Two ways through:
 *   PROTECT   Piece together when and where the Back Row will strike. Then tip off
 *             Detective Graves (Police) and/or warn the Bluebirds, who adore Vale.
 *             Best ending: Graves calls you back and you tell her it was you; or Alice
 *             Beaumont invites you to the gala ball; or ask any Police or Bluebird
 *             match on a date. They all say yes now. The Bluebird endings are a win:
 *             they vote you in and marry you off (host.bride picks her, host.win plays it).
 *   BACK ROW  Ring Vanessa Greer back and join. Order Semtex, wire and a phone to your
 *             door, assemble it at your desk, leave it on the doorstep for Allison to
 *             collect, then dial the number on Day A. Best ending: Vanessa sides with you.
 *
 * Fiction only. Professor Adrian Vale resembles no real person. The device is shown at
 * story level: three delivered items, a symbol-matching note and a steady-hands check.
 * No real-world method is described anywhere.
 *
 * Time rule: simulated days only ("Day 5"). No weekdays, dates or clock times.
 * State lives at world.professorVale, so it is saved and loaded with the world.
